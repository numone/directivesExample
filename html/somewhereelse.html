<div>
    I am in the somewhereElse controller. You can see the value here: {{somewhereElseText}}

    <br />
    You can see me load the child controller here with this directive tag, which is used on the main controller too:
    <br />
    <child-area></child-area>
    <br />
    <a ng-href="/#/">click here</a> to go back to the main controller
</div>
